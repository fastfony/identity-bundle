* Fastfony/IdentityBundle is almost ready:

1. Generate the database tables by running one of the following commands:
    Option 1 - Generate and run migrations to create the database tables:
        php bin/console doctrine:migrations:diff
        php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate

    Option 2 - You can create the schema directly
        php bin/console doctrine:schema:update --force
2. Enjoy! (you can also read the documentation in <comment>docs/</comment> for more information)
